# ![Middlesex Shield](/assets/mx_shield_small.png) DiningHallTracker

## Project Overview
Duty posts at the entrance and exit of the Dining Hall will check students in and out by dorm. This tracker will allow duty staff to increase or decrease the number of students, by dorm, currently seated. Changes automatically trigger an update of the whole page. As the number of seats decreases, the number of current diners and the number of seats remaining will change background from light green to yellow then light red to reflect limited remaining seats. The entire form can be reset with a subtle, yet effective, button on the bottom of the Duty page. <br> <br>
A view-only version of this page exists for community members to monitor the current seating in the Ware Dining Hall. <br> <br>
This project was a special request from Terry Cunningham on behalf of the Administrative Team.
